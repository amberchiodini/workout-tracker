## Description:
I created an application that creates new workouts and adds exercises to existing ones. The user is also able to track specific details about the exercise (i.e. weight, reps, distance etc).

## Technologies Used: 
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Installation:
In order to get started on this application, you will first need to ```git clone``` the GitHub repository onto your current working directory. Then, do an ```npm i``` to install all of your node modules. Lastly, create a ```.gitignore``` file for your node modules.
